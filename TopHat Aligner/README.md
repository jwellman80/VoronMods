## TopHat alignment "Pegs" for the StealthChanger TopHat

My TopHat is held in place with good old gravity.  But I wanted a way to keep the TopHat aligned with the main printer frame and didn't want it to slide off.  

There are a total of 8 tabs, 2 in each corner.  They are held in place by a push in T-Nut and a M3x10mm SHCS Screw. 

StealthChanger logo was added after the fact in the slicer so these are just blank.
