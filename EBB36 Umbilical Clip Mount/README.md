#### <span style="color:red">Caution: The space between the toolhead and your first umbilical support point will need to be longer or the spring steel will twist at the front corners of the bed. </span>


### Installation: 
- Use a pair of pliers to insert the spring steel perpendicular to the mount, it should embed about 5mm into the part. 
- Bend the steel to the top.  Use the pliers or something hard to press down on the spring steel near the point of insertion to crease the bed more.
- Hold the plate in place and loosly attach the top 2 screws. 
- Install the bottom screw and tighten all screws.
