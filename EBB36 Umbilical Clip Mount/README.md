- Use a pair of pliers to insert the spring steel perpendicular to the mount, it should embed about 5mm into the part. 
- Bend the steel to the top.  Use the pliers or something hard to press down on the spring steel near the point of insertion to crease the bed more.
- Hold the plate in place and loosly attach the top 2 screws. 
- Install the bottom screw and tighten all screws.
